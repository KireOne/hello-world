Bit
A bit, also known as a Shannon, is the basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two
values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a 0or1.
The term bit is a portmanteau of binary digit.
